/**
 * <p><b>Problem Statement:</b>
 * <p>Given a string S and a set of words D, find the longest word in D that is a subsequence of S.</p>
 * <p>Word W is a subsequence of S if some number of characters, possibly zero, can be deleted from S to form W, without reordering the remaining characters.
 * <p>* Note: D can appear in any format (list, hash table, prefix tree, etc.)</p>
 * <p>For example, given the input of S = "abppplee" and D = {"able", "ale", "apple", "bale", "kangaroo"} the correct output would be "apple".</p>
 * <p>The words "able" and "ale" are both subsequences of S, but they are shorter than "apple".</p>
 * <p>The word "bale" is not a subsequence of S because even though S has all the right letters, they are not in the right order.</p>
 * <p>The word "kangaroo" is the longest word in D, but it isn't a subsequence of S.</p>
